# ESP32-Remote-Gate-Control-System
The ESP32 Remote Gate Control System is a simple solution for remotely controlling and monitoring a gate or entry point. It consists of an ESP32-based receiver unit that interfaces with a relay to physically open and close the gate, and a web-based control interface that allows users to trigger the gate remotely.
